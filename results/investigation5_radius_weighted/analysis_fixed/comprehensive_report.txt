INVESTIGATION 5: RADIUS-WEIGHTED TRAINING
Comprehensive Analysis Report
================================================================================

Split Type: Fixed
Datasets Analyzed: 9

HYPOTHESIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Radius weighting adds confidence signal based on node centrality.
Expected behavior:
  1. SIMPLE methods (RowNorm) lack magnitude info → should BENEFIT
  2. COMPLEX methods (Log-Mag, Nested) already use magnitude → should HURT (redundancy)

HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIMPLE methods benefit: 4/9 (44.4%)
Log-Magnitude hurts: 5/9 (55.6%)
Nested Spheres hurts: 3/9 (33.3%)
Full hypothesis confirmed: 2/9 (22.2%)

FRAMEWORK SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part A: Basis sensitivity (SGC+MLP → Restricted+StandardMLP)
Part B: RowNorm effect (Restricted+StandardMLP → Restricted+RowNorm)
Part B.5: Magnitude preservation (Log-Magnitude augmentation)
Part B.6: Eigenvalue structure (Nested Spheres)
Part B.7: Radius weighting effect (NEW)

Mean effects across datasets:
  Part A: -13.39pp ± 15.79pp
  Part B: +7.61pp ± 13.70pp
  Part B.5: +6.99pp ± 11.32pp
  Part B.6: +9.62pp ± 14.02pp
  Part B.7 (RowNorm): -0.14pp ± 0.61pp
  Part B.7 (Log-Mag): -0.14pp ± 0.56pp
  Part B.7 (Nested): -0.13pp ± 0.60pp

OVERSMOOTHING ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparing k=2 vs k=10 performance:

Datasets with severe oversmoothing (>5pp degradation): 4/9
Mean SGC oversmoothing: -5.73pp
Mean MLP oversmoothing: +0.90pp

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Radius weighting represents a confidence-based training approach that:
  ~ Inconsistently helps SIMPLE methods
  ✗ Does not consistently hurt COMPLEX methods (redundancy not confirmed)
